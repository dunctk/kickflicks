# KickFlicks 
### A simple web app designed to be a searchable list of the best Kickstarter videos.

I built this partly because I was working with a couple of startups to produce videos to promote their Kickstarter campaigns. (you can read more about one of those [here](https://www.crowdcrux.com/proven-tips-for-making-a-kickstarter-pitch-video-that-converts/)). 

In order to get some inspiration, I wanted to have an easy way to view just the videos from campaigns that exceeded their funding goals.

This project contains a Scrapy crawler which crawls Kickstarter.com to get the video links, and then a MeteorJS app which displays the top videos and allows you to search through.
