					<h1>Showcasing crowdfunding pitch videos from the best campaigns</h1>
					<p>To help answer the question <em>what makes a good pitch video?</em>, we've pulled together videos from all the campaigns on Kickstarter where the total amount raised was at least 5x their original goal.</p>
					<p>They must have been doing something right to do that well, and we're willing to bet that the video was a significant contributing factor in their success.</p>
